"""
Version history:
    v1 - built using Room references (basically a graph). 
        downside: you have to create all rooms, then link
        them together afterwards.
        
    v2 - used constant room IDs to make it possible to add
        and link rooms in one pass. 
        downside: "this looks like BASIC" (from the peanut gallery)
        
    v3 - realization: if the Room names are unique, that's a
        unique ID. I therefore changed
        the container for all Rooms to be a dictionary --
        now it's easy enough to look up the room by name.
