Assignment M2HW: Lists and Files
See the Pokedex file referenced in this assignment.

We only care about the first 151 pokemon in the list. 
Of the fields in the CSV, we care about:
id, identifier, height, weight
identifier is a string, the rest are integers.

Tier list: 
Bronze - Questions 1 and 2
Silver - [To be posted]
Gold   - [To be posted]

Question 1
Your program should provide a menu with a number option
for each question answered. 
Menu option 1 is "List all Pokemon".
Read each pokemon from the file and create a list which
contains all the names (just the names for this question)
Then iterate through the list, printing each name. Rather
than print them one one line each, print the names with 
commas between them.

Here's an example run:
1 - List All Pokemon
The Pokemon are: bulbasar, ivysaur, venusaur, 
[... lots of lines removed]
,dragonite, mewto, mew.

Question 2
Menu option 2 is "Search for a Pokemon"
Ask the user for a Pokemon name. 
For each name in the list of Pokemon that matches,
print id, identifier, height, and weight.
I recommond you create a list of lists (that is, each
pokemon is an individual list, and the master list has
all 151), but there are other ways you could structure
this data.

Here's an example run:
2 - Pokemon Search
Enter a name: saur
1 	bulbasaur 	Height: 7 	Weight: 69
2 	ivysaur 	Height: 10 	Weight: 130
3 	venusaur 	Height: 20 	Weight: 1000
